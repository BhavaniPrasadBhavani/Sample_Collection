# Sample Collection API

A backend API for a sample collection app built with Node.js, Express.js, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL with Prisma as the ORM.


**Implementation**

The API server is currently running on http://localhost:3000 with all features implemented:
- Authentication with JWT
- Sample management CRUD operations  
- Protected routes with middleware
- TypeScript code
- Proper error handling

## What I Couldn't Finish (But Wanted To)

To be honest, I wasn’t able to finish everything I originally planned due to time constraints. One feature I was really excited to build (but couldn't complete in time) was:

**Delay Reporting / Rescheduling Samples**  
Agents often face real-world delays — like traffic or connectivity issues. I had planned to allow agents to update the scheduled pickup time or report a delay, along with the reason. I believe this would’ve made the system more practical and usable in the field.

## Trickier Parts I Faced

Some parts of the project were more challenging than expected:

###  Folder Structure & Service Separation
It took me a while to figure out how to cleanly separate **controllers**, **routes**, and **services** in a modular way using TypeScript. I had to re-structure things a couple of times to make it cleaner.

###  Learning prisma
I used **Prisma ORM** to interact with the database — but to be completely honest, most of my Prisma setup was guided heavily by AI (thanks ChatGPT 😅). I haven’t used it much before this, so I was learning as I went. It was super helpful but also confusing in parts (especially relations and schema migrations).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- PostgreSQL
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up environment variables:
Copy `.env` and update with your database credentials:
```env
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/sampledb"
JWT_SECRET="your-super-secret-and-long-key-for-jwt"
```

3. Generate Prisma client and push database schema:
```bash
npm run db:generate
npm run db:push
```

4. Build the project:
```bash
npm run build
```

5. Start the server:
```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/v1/auth/register` - Register a new agent
- `POST /api/v1/auth/login` - Login agent

### Samples (Protected Routes)
- `GET /api/v1/samples/:agentId` - Get samples for an agent
- `POST /api/v1/samples` - Create a new sample
- `PATCH /api/v1/samples/:sampleId/collect` - Mark sample as collected
- `POST /api/v1/samples/:sampleId/report-delay` - Report a delay

## Database Schema

**Currently using SQLite for easy development and testing**

### Agent
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `name`: Agent name
- `phone`: Unique phone number
- `password`: Hashed password

### Sample
- `id`: Unique identifier
- `patientName`: Patient name
- `pickupAddress`: Pickup location
- `status`: String - "SCHEDULED" | "COLLECTED" | "CANCELLED" | "DELAYED"
- `priority`: String - "HIGH" | "MEDIUM" | "LOW"
- `scheduledDate`: Date for collection
- `notes`: Optional notes
- `agentId`: Reference to agent
- `createdAt` / `updatedAt`: Timestamps

## Usage Examples

### Register Agent
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "John Doe", "phone": "1234567890", "password": "securepassword"}'
```

### Login
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"phone": "1234567890", "password": "securepassword"}'
```

### Create Sample
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/samples \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"patientName": "Jane Smith", "pickupAddress": "123 Main St", "scheduledDate": "2025-08-07", "priority": "HIGH", "agentId": "agent_id"}'
```
